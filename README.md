# spock-rock-game-project

The "Spock-Rock" game is a rock-paper-scissors style game based on an episode of the ["Big Bang Theory"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=405Nh2H4Ucg) in which one of the characters introduces the game and explains the rules of play.
## What I Learned

* Use of the JavaScript [```switch```](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp) statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed
* Use of the [DOM ```onclick``` event](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp)
* Using the DOM window object to make a function global once it has been containerized in a module. Example:
  * ```window.select = select;```
  * ```window.resetAll = resetAll;```
* Using [```Array.prototype.indexOf()```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) to find the index of an element in an array
* CSS ```border-top-left-radius``` and ```border-top-right-radius``` to specifically modify the radius of corners
* CSS [```:last-of-type```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-of-type) pseudo-class to modify the styling of a selector
* CSS [```box-shadow``` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)

## Future Modifications and Enhancements

* Replace [FontAwesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free) with [Noun Project icons](https://thenounproject.com/icons/)
* Make the ```checkResult()``` function in ```script.js``` behave more like a conventional game engine loop
